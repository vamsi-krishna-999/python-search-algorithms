In network routing, Depth-First Search (DFS) can be utilized to find 
routes or paths between nodes in a network. The network can be 
represented as a graph, where nodes represent network devices 
(routers, switches, servers) and edges represent connections 
between these devices.

Let's consider a simplified example where we have a 
small network with routers connected to each :

       A
      / \
     B   C
    / \ / \
   D   E   F


Nodes A, B, C, D, E, and F represent routers in the network.
The edges between nodes represent connections between routers.

Router A is connected to routers B and C,
router B is connected to routers D and E, and so on.

Now, let's say we want to find a path from router A to router F using DFS.


DFS Algorithm for Network Routing:

Start at the source node (router A in this case).
Visit the source node and mark it as visited.
Explore the adjacent unvisited nodes (routers) from the current node (router). Choose one of the adjacent unvisited nodes arbitrarily.
Repeat step 3 recursively until the destination node (router F) is reached or until all possible paths have been explored.
If the destination node is reached, the path from the source node to the destination node is found.
Backtrack to the previous node if there are no more unvisited adjacent nodes to explore.
Example:

Let's perform DFS starting from router A and find a path to router F:

Start at router A.
Visit router A and mark it as visited.
Explore the adjacent unvisited nodes from router A. Let's say we choose router B.
Visit router B and mark it as visited.
Explore the adjacent unvisited nodes from router B. Let's say we choose router D.
Visit router D and mark it as visited.
Explore the adjacent unvisited nodes from router D. There are no unvisited nodes, so backtrack to router B.
Explore the remaining adjacent unvisited node from router B, which is router E.
Visit router E and mark it as visited.
Explore the adjacent unvisited nodes from router E. There are no unvisited nodes, so backtrack to router B.
Since router B has no more unvisited adjacent nodes, backtrack to router A.
Explore the remaining adjacent unvisited node from router A, which is router C.
Visit router C and mark it as visited.
Explore the adjacent unvisited nodes from router C. Let's say we choose router F.
Visit router F and mark it as visited. The destination node is reached.
The path from router A to router F is: A -> B -> D -> E -> C -> F
