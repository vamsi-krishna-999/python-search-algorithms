Limitations of DFS:
=======================
DFS may not find the shortest path between two nodes 
in a weighted graph since it does not consider the weight of edges.

It can get stuck in infinite loops if the graph contains cycles 
and proper cycle detection mechanisms are not employed.

DFS may consume a lot of memory if the depth of the recursion 
is too high, leading to a stack overflow error.



Various Stages of Time Complexities:
=========================================
Best Case Time Complexity: O(|V| + |E|), where |V| is the number of vertices and |E| is the number of edges.
Worst Case Time Complexity: O(|V| + |E|).
Average Case Time Complexity: O(|V| + |E|).
Space Complexity: O(|V|), where |V| is the number of vertices.
