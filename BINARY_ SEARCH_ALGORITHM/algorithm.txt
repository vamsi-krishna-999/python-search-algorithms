Procedure:

Start with the entire sorted array.
Set two pointers, low and high, to the start and end of the array respectively.
Calculate the middle index of the array: mid = (low + high) // 2.
Compare the target value with the middle element of the array:
If the target value matches the middle element, return the index.
If the target value is less than the middle element, search the left half of the array.
If the target value is greater than the middle element, search the right half of the array.
Repeat steps 3-4 until the target value is found or the search interval becomes empty.
